    Note that in Scotland, Land and Building Transaction Tax ('LBTT') will instead apply and in Wales, Land Transaction Tax. Separate specific advice should be taken where a Scottish or Welsh property is involved. <br/><br/>
    
    ii) The Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings ('ATED'') will not be relevant in this situation.<br/><br/>
    
    iii)Capital Gains Tax [“CGT”]can arise on any profit on the sale of the property. This also applies to non-UK resident individuals and non-UK resident companies.  <br/><br/>

   Individuals and companies may, however, find that any profit may be treated as income if the property was bought with a  view to sale at a profit. In that situation, the profit can be taxed at the normal marginal income tax rate (for individuals) or 20% for non-resident companies and corporation tax for UK resident companies.<br/><br/>
