   Note that in Scotland, Land and Building Transaction Tax will instead apply and in Wales, Land Transaction Tax. Separate specific advice should be taken where a Scottish or Welsh property is involved. <br/><br/>

    ii)  The Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings ('ATED') will not be chargeable in this situation.<br/><br/>

    iii)  Capital Gains Tax ['CGT']will apply to both UK residents and non-residents if a profit is made on the sale of the property. Individuals and companies may, however, find that any profit may be treated as income if the property was bought with a  view to sale at a profit. In that situation, the profit can be taxed at the normal marginal income tax rate (for individuals) or 20% for non-resident companies and corporation tax for UK resident companies. </p><br/><br/>
