    <p>In addition, there could be a surcharge of another  3% (which, in the case of a corporate purchasers, can arise even if only one property is acquired).</p>

         <p> Note that in Scotland, Land and Building Transaction Tax will instead apply and in Wales, Land Transaction Tax. Separate specific advice should be taken where a Scottish or Welsh property is involved. <br/><br/>

             ii) The Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings ('ATED') will not be relevant in this situation.<br/><br/>
       
      
    ii) Capital Gains Tax ('CGT') will apply to both UK residents and non-residents if a profit is made on the sale of the property, unless the property was bought as a principal private residence, in which case the main residence exemption from CGT can apply (although there may still be conditions to fulfil if e.g. the owner is not UK resident or there is more than one property used as a residence.<br/><br/> 

    Individuals can still find, however, find that any profit may be treated as income if the property was bought with a  view to sale at a profit. In that situation, the profit can be taxed at the normal marginal income tax rate and there would be no main residence exemption.<p></p><br/><br/>
