        Philip Spencer has spent 44 years in the accounting profession, specialising in taxation. He is the author of Property Tax Planning published by Bloomsbury, now in its 15th edition.<br/><br/>
            
        This dignostic tool aims to provide guidelines on the likely SDLT, ATED and CGT implications of buying real property in the UK. Note that this tool has been prepared as a prototype in a test project and its content should not be relied upon. <br/><br/> 
            
        As Scotland and Wales have separate land transaction taxes, the references to SDLT relate to property purchases in England and Northern Ireland.  <br/><br/>
