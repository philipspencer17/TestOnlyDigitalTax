<p> In this case:<br/><br/>

    i)  SDLT residential rates will apply in England and Northern Ireland with an additional 3% surcharge as the property buyer is a non-natural person. Relief from the highest, 15%, Stamp Duty Land Tax (‘SDLT’) charge should be available as th eproperty is being used for a business purpose but this relief must be claimed on the Land Transaction Return. Note, however, that properties purchased for less than £40,000 are exempt but full normal rates apply for purchases in excess of this</p><br/>

    <p>The current rates and bands including the surcharge are as follows;</p><br/>

Note that in Scotland, Land and Building Transaction Tax will instead apply and in Wales, Land Transaction Tax. Separate specific advice should be taken where a Scottish or Welsh property is involved. <br/><br/>

 ii) No Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (‘ATED’) arises. As simplified ATED return is required to be submitted annually to HMRC to claim the relief.<br/><br/>

iii) Capital Gains Tax (‘CGT’) will be payable on capital gains realised. For companies, the rate is 20%. <br/><br/>  
      
    Note that if one of the motives for buying the property was to realise a gain on sale, any profit could be treated as income from trading.</p>
